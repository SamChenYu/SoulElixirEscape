# SoulElixirEscape
Game Made For QMUL's Game Development Society October 2023 Game Jam

Step into a world where you've met your end and now find yourself in the depths of purgatory, a place where you're inexplicably missing something essential - your soul. The key to reclaiming your former life lies in collecting ten soul elixirs, a daunting task. Yet, for each elixir you retrieve, a restless ghost materializes, driven by a desire to fill the void left by their own missing souls. The challenge intensifies as you must outmaneuver these spirits or forever grapple with the emptiness of missing your soul.
